# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?

R squared value: 0.6257932855322312; This says that the linear regression model's line of best fit is somewhat close to the graph. 

This says that the linear regression model has a strong correlation between age and systolic blood pressure.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 42 years old?

136.52043597

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think that this model's predicitons are somewhat accurate, but not accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age because of the small data set. There are only 13 examples used as data for all ages. To improve the model, we could use a bigger blood pressure data set to have more information and achieve a more reliable, accurate result.
