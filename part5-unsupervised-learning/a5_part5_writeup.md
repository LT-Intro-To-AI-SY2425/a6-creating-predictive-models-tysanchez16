2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Cheapskate because their spending habit is low when they could theoretically shop more due to their medium income.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

Baller; a marketing team could attract this specific customer group by advertising how their product is *NEW*, a *MUST HAVE*, and a better alternative to other similar popular products. This will make them feel inclined to buy the product and with their high income & high spending habits, they are likely to fold and buy the product.
