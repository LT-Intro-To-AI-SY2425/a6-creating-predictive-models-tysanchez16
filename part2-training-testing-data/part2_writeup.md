# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?

There is training data and test data used to test the line of best fit, which the previous model did not have.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The graphs line of best fit is somewhat close to the point on the graph and has a strong correlation

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

Besides one outlier, the predictions are somewhat accurate since they are not far off the line of best fit. The outlier could have influenced the R squared coefficient to be decrease, though it is still a higher value than in the last model, meaning it's more accurate than the last model. There is still room for improvement.
