# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?

0.86, this means that the line of best fit is very close to the actual values in the model and has a very strong correlation.

2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?

Yes the model is accurate because the R squared value is above 0.75 and the data points are not far from the line of best fit.

3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?

$8,140.76
-$557.94

4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

I think this is happening because the value of the car is so low, due to age and mileage, that it is not worth anything. The equation does not stop at zero so the value goes negative and continues to follow the pattern of the model in the graph.
